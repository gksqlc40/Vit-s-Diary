<p>
Today is rainy day. I like rain. Beacause Its sound is very good. Like fried Popcorn.<br>
I'm so hungry now. Beacause I didn't eat dinner till now. It's 11 P.M. arround. <br>
Maybe I will go C.S. And I will eat some eggs and something not a Ramen. I ate a Ramen last night. <br>
I bought a book. It was written Jordan B. Peterson. He is a Professor in Canada. <br>
I like him. His talking is very powerful and reliable. And I will read it before going to bed.<br>
I was late from my job. So I worked as late as I am. So I finished job arround 3 P.M. <br>
I don't know What I say. It's '의식의 흐름'. Like Trash..... <br>
I am looking forward to tomorrow. Beacause I will go new sport I will meet my friend, and study codding. <br>
It's so late. But I drank a cup of coffee. I might go to bed at Three P.M..<br>
Today was a quiet day. I went to my job, tought my student and studied. <br>
But, My heart was quiet. Maybe It's beacause of the rain. <br> </p>
<h2>See you tomorrow. I'll be Back!</h2> <br> <br>
